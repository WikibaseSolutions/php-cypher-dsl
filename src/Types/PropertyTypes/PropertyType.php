/**
 * Represents any property type in Cypher.
 *
 * Property types are types that:
 *
 * - can be returned from Cypher queries
 * - can be used as parameters
 * - can be stored as properties
 * - can be constructed with Cypher literals
 *
 * The property types are:
 *
 * - number, which has subtypes integer and float
 * - string
 * - boolean
 * - point
 * - temporal, which has subtypes date, time, localtime, datetime, localdatetime and duration
 *
 * Homogeneous lists of simple types can also be stored as properties, although lists in
 * general cannot.
 *
 * @see  PropertyTypeTrait for a default implementation
 * @note This interface should not be implemented by any class directly
 *
 * @see https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/syntax/values/#property-types Corresponding documentation on Neo4j.com
