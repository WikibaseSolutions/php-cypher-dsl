# Version lifecycle

Since php-cypher-dsl version 5.0.0, support is governed by this version
lifecycle.

**Bugfix support** means that issues will be fixed for a version of
php-cypher-dsl. Bugfix support for every major release `X` ends **six months**
after the release of the next major version (`X+1`). Bugfix support for minor
release `X.Y` will end with the release of the next minor version (`X.(Y+1)`).

It is strongly recommended to use a version of php-cypher-dsl that has active
bugfix support. Versions that are no longer receiving bugfix support will not
receive any security or bug fixes. They may contain known critical
vulnerabilities and other major bugs, including the threat of possible data
loss and/or corruption.
